This repo contains any tools, techniques or scripts that I have used to break web applications, I will do my best to link relevant sources if they have been taken from elsewhere. As a hacker who believes strongly in the words written in [the hacker's manifesto](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html) I believe that information should be free and not hidden behind the pay wall of some crappy course, so feel free to use any of it as you see fit with the exception of own monetary gain. 

If anything in this repo has helped you please consider donating to [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/donate)

Knowledge is power, hack the planet and be excellent to each other.
